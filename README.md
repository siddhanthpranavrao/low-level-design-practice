# 🧠 Low-Level Design Practice

A curated collection of low-level design (LLD) problems and implementations in Java.  
This repo is built for serious engineers who want to master **object-oriented design**, **design patterns**, and **system components** through hands-on code.

---

## 🚀 What You'll Find

- 🔁 Real-world design problems (e.g., Parking Lot, BookMyShow, Cache, Rate Limiter)
- 🎯 SOLID principles and design patterns (Strategy, Observer, Factory, etc.)
- ✅ Clean, testable, modular Java code
- 📚 Explanations and class diagrams where applicable

## 🧑‍💻 Ideal For

- Software engineers preparing for **LLD interviews**
- Backend devs looking to **sharpen OO design**
- Anyone learning **Java design patterns by implementation**

---

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/siddhanthpranavrao/low-level-design-practice.git
   ```
2. Open in your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ or VS Code)
3. Navigate by topic or system
4. Read the problem → study the classes → run the code → tweak → repeat

## 🌟 Future Plans

- [ ] Add more concurrency-safe designs
- [ ] Visual UML diagrams for all systems
- [ ] Add explanations & step-by-step thought process for each LLD
